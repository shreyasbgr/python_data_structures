Instructions: Write the prepend method


*** Solution Explanation ***
def prepend(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)
        if self.length == 0:
            self.head = new_node
            self.tail = new_node
        else:
            new_node.next = self.head
            self.head = new_node
        self.length += 1
        return True 



Big O:

O( 1 )

Constant Time

No matter how large the linked list is, the number of operations taken to execute prepend remains constant

Constant time is another name for O( 1 )
