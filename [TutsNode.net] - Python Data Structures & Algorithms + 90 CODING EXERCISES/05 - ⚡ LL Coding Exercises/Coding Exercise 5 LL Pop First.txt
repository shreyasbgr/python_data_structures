*** Solution Explanation ***
def pop_first(self):
        if self.length == 0:
            return None
        temp = self.head
        self.head = self.head.next
        temp.next = None
        self.length -= 1
        if self.length == 0:
            self.tail = None
        return temp

Big O:

O( 1 )

Constant Time

No matter how large the linked list is, the number of operations taken to execute pop_first remains constant

Constant time is another name for O( 1 )
