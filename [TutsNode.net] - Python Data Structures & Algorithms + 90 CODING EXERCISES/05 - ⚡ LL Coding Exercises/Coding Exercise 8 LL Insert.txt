Instructions:
Write the insert method

*** Solution Explanation ***
def insert(self, index, value):
        if index < 0 or index > self.length:
            return False
        if index == 0:
            return self.prepend(value)
        if index == self.length:
            return self.append(value)
        new_node = Node(value)
        temp = self.get(index - 1)
        new_node.next = temp.next
        temp.next = new_node
        self.length += 1   
        return True  


Big O:

O( n )

n is the number of nodes in the linked list

When we say that the time complexity of a linked list operation is O(n), we mean that the execution time of the operation grows linearly with the size of the linked list. In other words, as the number of elements in the linked list increases, the time taken to perform the operation increases at the same rate.

An algorithm with a single loop that iterates through all n items in the worst case has a time complexity of O(n)

insert uses the get method, which is O(n), to iterate through the linked list
