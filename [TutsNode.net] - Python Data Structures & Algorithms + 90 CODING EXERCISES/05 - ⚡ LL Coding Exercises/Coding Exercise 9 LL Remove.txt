Instructions:
Write the remove method

*** Solution Explanation ***
def remove(self, index):
        if index < 0 or index >= self.length:
            return None
        if index == 0:
            return self.pop_first()
        if index == self.length - 1:
            return self.pop()
        pre = self.get(index - 1)
        temp = pre.next
        pre.next = temp.next
        temp.next = None
        self.length -= 1
        return temp




Big O:

O( n )

n is the number of nodes in the linked list

When we say that the time complexity of a linked list operation is O(n), we mean that the execution time of the operation grows linearly with the size of the linked list. In other words, as the number of elements in the linked list increases, the time taken to perform the operation increases at the same rate.

An algorithm with a single loop that iterates through all n items in the worst case has a time complexity of O(n)

remove uses the get method, which is O(n), to iterate through the linked list
