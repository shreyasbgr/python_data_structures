Bubble Sort
Write the bubble_sort function

*** Solution Explanation ***
def bubble_sort(my_list):
    for i in range(len(my_list) - 1, 0 ,-1):
        for j in range(i):
            if my_list[j] > my_list[j+1]:
                temp = my_list[j]
                my_list[j] = my_list[j+1]
                my_list[j+1] = temp
    return my_list


The algorithm works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements in a list until the list is sorted in ascending order.

Here is how the code works:

The function takes an input list as an argument.

The outer loop of the code runs from len(my_list) - 1 to 1 (inclusive) using the range function, with a step size of -1. This outer loop will make n-1 passes through the list where n is the length of the list. By starting from the end of the list, this loop ensures that each iteration finds the maximum element and moves it to the end of the unsorted part of the list.

The inner loop runs over each pair of adjacent elements in the unsorted part of the list. It starts at index 0 and runs up to i - 1, where i is the current index of the outer loop. This loop checks whether the element at index j is greater than the element at index j + 1. If it is, then it swaps the elements, which moves the larger element to the right. After this loop completes, the largest element in the unsorted part of the list is moved to the end.

After the outer and inner loops have run, the sorted list is returned.





Code with inline comments:



def bubble_sort(my_list):
    # loop over the list n-1 times, where n is the length of the list
    # starting from the end and going backwards
    for i in range(len(my_list) - 1, 0 ,-1):
        # loop over each pair of adjacent elements up to i - 1
        for j in range(i):
            # check if the current element is greater than the next element
            if my_list[j] > my_list[j+1]:
                # if so, swap the elements using a temporary variable
                temp = my_list[j]
                my_list[j] = my_list[j+1]
                my_list[j+1] = temp
    # return the sorted list
    return my_list
