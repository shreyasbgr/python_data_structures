Merge
Write the merge helper function

*** Solution Explanation ***
def merge(list1, list2):
    combined = []
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i < len(list1) and j < len(list2):
        if list1[i] < list2[j]:
            combined.append(list1[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            combined.append(list2[j])
            j += 1
              
    while i < len(list1):
        combined.append(list1[i])
        i += 1
 
    while j < len(list2):
        combined.append(list2[j])
        j += 1
 
    return combined


Merge takes in two sorted lists of numbers, merges them, and returns a single sorted list that contains all the elements of the two input lists. Here is how the code works:

The function takes in two lists list1 and list2 as input.

The function initializes an empty list combined to store the merged result.

The function initializes two variables i and j to zero to keep track of the current index of each input list.

The function enters a while loop that continues as long as both i and j are less than the lengths of list1 and list2, respectively.

Inside the while loop, the function compares the current values of list1[i] and list2[j]. If list1[i] is less than list2[j], it is added to the combined list and i is incremented. Otherwise, list2[j] is added to the combined list and j is incremented.

After the while loop ends, the function enters two more while loops to add any remaining elements from list1 or list2 to the combined list.

Finally, the function returns the combined list.


Overall, the function merges two sorted lists by iterating over the lists and comparing their elements. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the merged list, since each element is compared exactly once.





Code with inline comments:



def merge(list1, list2):
    combined = []  # initialize an empty list to store the merged result
    i = 0  # initialize the index of list1 to zero
    j = 0  # initialize the index of list2 to zero
    while i < len(list1) and j < len(list2):
        # compare the current elements of list1 and list2, and append the smaller one to combined
        if list1[i] < list2[j]:
            combined.append(list1[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            combined.append(list2[j])
            j += 1
              
    # if there are any remaining elements in list1, add them to combined
    while i < len(list1):
        combined.append(list1[i])
        i += 1
 
    # if there are any remaining elements in list2, add them to combined
    while j < len(list2):
        combined.append(list2[j])
        j += 1
 
    return combined  # return the merged and sorted list
